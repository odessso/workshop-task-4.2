# workshop-task-4.2
Park Battlefield

## Task Description:

I wanted to create a more lighthearted fun interactive code where the user somewhat has a say on the vibe of the code - whether it is a chill or hostile environment. I decided to work with simple imagery of cats and dogs and work with the longstanding phenomenon that they are at war with eachother. I wanted to have the images switch to similar sized images in the same position as the previous spawned ones, seamlessly when the user checks a checkbox, so that it looks as if the spawned images transformed rather than got replaced.

I wanted the code to have that sort of early videogame look, inspired by games like "Terraria" or old nintendo gameplay. I really like side scrolling videogames and would love for my coding work to pull inspiration from the layout of them. I like how there can be some surprise in what next appears in those types of games.

## Notes:

- Defintely a step up in challenge to transform spawned images into other images while mainting similar sizing and placement.
- I had to convert the dog/cat images into pngs again in photoshop so that they became little characters without a background behind them.
- I found a pixelated park scene to use as a basic background for the code - I used AI generative expand in photoshop again so that I could convert a somewhat small cropped image into an expansive backdrop. It did a really good job duplicating the trees, I only had to tidy up a few random abnormalities.
- I used the "push" images code to help input the images into my code so that they spawned.
- I divided the canvas into quarters so that I could make the dog and cat imagery spawn only in certain areas - dogs in bottom left quarter, cats in bottom right quarter.
- I found it pretty simple to learn how to get the images to transform into alternative versions (the angry dogs and cats), labelling everything with d1 or d2 and c1 or c2 made it easy to navigate.

## Problems Faced:

- I was having trouble again with the actual image files being too large, so when they spawned they were way too big and took up lots of the canvas or spawned half off the screen. I found the easiest way to fix this was to go into the original image files and resize them, then the code would update and I could tweak it from there.
- I had trouble attaching the labels to the slider and also positioning the checkbox, slider and buttons depending on the ratios of the window. In future I need to find neater ways of centrering everything.
- I had absolutely no clue how to get the spawned images to "shake", however I really wanted this to be an attribute controlled by the user. I wanted this to be linked to the slider function so that you could watch the images increase in shakiness in increments rather than just 0 or 100. I consulted ChatGPT to help with this and after a few attempts it was very helpful. It intiially kept on deleting/forgetting other functions such as the "fight" button so it took quite a lot of trial and error and inputting different versions of the code.
